Here’s a clean, instructor-ready exercise prompt that tells students **what** to do without giving **how-to** steps, perfect for students who have a Git cheat sheet to reference.

# **Exercise: Create a Java Project and Manage It with Git (Terminal Only)**

Your task is to create a new Java project in IntelliJ and manage the project’s version control using **only the terminal and git commands**—not IntelliJ’s built-in Git tools.

### **Instructions**

1. **Create a new Java project in IntelliJ**

   * Include at least one Java class with a small amount of sample functionality.
   * You may choose any simple program (e.g., printing output, doing a basic calculation, etc.).

2. **Initialize version control using Git in the terminal**

   * Turn your project folder into a Git repository.
   * Stage and commit all project files using terminal commands only.

3. **Create an empty GitHub repository manually (in the browser)**

   * Do **not** let GitHub auto-create files (no README, no .gitignore).
   * Connect your local repository to this GitHub repository as a remote.
   * Push your initial commit up to GitHub.

4. **Make two rounds of updates to your code**
   For each round:

   * Make a small change to your Java code.
   * Use only terminal commands to stage, commit, and push your changes.
   * Confirm your updates appear on GitHub after each push.

5. **Verify that the commit history on GitHub shows the progression of your work.**

If you'd like, I can also create:

* A version for beginners with clearer constraints but still not step-by-step
* A rubric
* A downloadable PDF or assignment sheet
